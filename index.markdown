I'm a Senior Economist at Amazon, on the Demand Forecasting team. I work at the intersection of time-series econometrics and machine learning to produce forecasting models for a variety of demand series across Amazon. My research on applied time-series forecasting has been published by the National Bureau of Economic Research ([NBER](https://www.nber.org/books-and-chapters/big-data-twenty-first-century-economic-statistics/machine-learning-analysis-seasonal-and-cyclical-sales-weekly-scanner-data)) and the International Conference on Machine Learning ([ICML](https://roseyu.com/time-series-workshop/submissions/2021/TSW-ICML2021_paper_23.pdf)). 

I hold a PhD in financial economics from Harvard University, where I was advised by [Jeremy Stein](https://scholar.harvard.edu/stein/home). My research focused on applying tools from state-space modeling and machine learning to a variety of subject areas in financial economics, ranging from bond pricing to seasonal adjustment. Before grad school, I was a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company, where I helped companies and governments solve strategic and operational problems. Before *that*, I was an undergrad at Columbia University where I worked with [Serena Ng](http://www.columbia.edu/~sn2294/) on analyzing macro trends in "big" retail purchasing data, wrote a senior thesis on the behavioral finance of Bitcoin advised by [Jos√© Scheinkman](https://www.princeton.edu/~joses/), and did some internships in finance/tech. 

I'm always interested in talking to people with similar research interests---if you'd like to chat, feel free to drop me an email at firstnamelastname at gmail dot com.
